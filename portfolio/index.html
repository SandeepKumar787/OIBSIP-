            <div class="project">
                <p>A calculator is a device or tool designed to perform mathematical calculations. It can range from simple, basic models that handle arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, to advanced versions capable of solving complex equations, performing statistical analysis, graphing functions, and even programming.</p>
                <br>
               
                <b>Types of Calculators :</b>

                 <b>History</b>
                 <ul>
                  <li>Early calculators were mechanical (e.g., abacus, slide rules.)</li>
                  <li>Electronic calculators emerged in the mid-20th century.</li>
                  <li>Modern calculators are often integrated into computers, phones, and other devices.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <h3>Calculators are widely used in education, finance, engineering, and everyday life for quick and accurate computations.</h3>

                <h1>ATM</h1>
                <p>An ATM (Automated Teller Machine) is an electronic banking device that allows customers to perform financial transactions without the need for a human teller. ATMs are widely available and provide convenient access to banking services 24/7.</p>
                <br>
                <b>Key Functions of an ATM:</b>
                
                <ol>
                
                  <li>Cash Withdrawals: Withdraw money from a bank account.</li>
                  <li>Balance Inquiry: Check the available balance in an account.</li>
                  <li>Deposits: Deposit cash or checks into an account.</li>
                  <li>Fund Transfers: Transfer money between linked accounts.</li>
                  <li>Fund Transfers: Transfer money between linked accounts.</li>
                  <li>Bill Payments: Pay utility bills or other expenses (in some regions).</li>
                  <li>Account Statements: Request mini-statements or transaction history.</li>
                  
                </ol>
                <br>
                <b>How It Works:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>A customer inserts a bank card (debit or credit card) into the ATM.</li>
                  <li>The machine reads the card's magnetic strip or chip and prompts the user to enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for security.</li>
                  <li>Once authenticated, the user can select and complete the desired transaction.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <b>Types of ATMs</b>
                <ol>
                  <li>On-Site ATMs: Located within bank branches</li>
                  <li>Off-Site ATMs: Found in public places like malls, airports, or gas stations.</li>
                  <li>White Label ATMs: Operated by non-bank entities.</li>
                  <li>Brown Label ATMs: Operated by third-party providers but owned by a bank.</li>
                  <li>Smart ATMs: Offer advanced features like cash recycling, biometric authentication, or cardless transactions.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <b>History</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>The first ATM was introduced by Barclays Bank in London in 1967.</li>
                  <li>Since then, ATMs have become a global standard for convenient banking.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4>ATMs have revolutionized banking by providing quick and secure access to financial services, reducing the need for in-branch visits</h4>
